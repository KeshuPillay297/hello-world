# hello-world
The starting point in my journey
My name is Keshu. I am an entry-level programmer.
I initially studied a Diploma in Software Development but I was unable to finish due to family finances 
Since I cant get a programming job the standard way. My plan is to use GitHub to work on OSS projects to gain experience for my CV.
This is the beginning of my journey into the Programming Industry. I will do everything I can to make this work
